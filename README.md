## Hello people of the Internet ðŸ˜„!

My name is Rachit and I am a budding Data Science enthusiast ðŸ’». I am extremely passionate about Data Science and all its various components. Currently I am a student pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at SUNY Univerity at Buffalo, New York.

I am adept at working with Python and R Programming Language for Data Science and Machine Learning.

I am also well versed in the use of business intelligence tools, namely: PowerBI, Tabluea, Apache Superset and KNIME.

Structured query languages also fall into my area of expertise as I am an efficient user of MySQL, PostGreSQL, SQLite3.

Ultimately my goal in life is to use the magic of data science/machine learning and impact people's lives positively; be it healthcare industry, helping small businesses, people with special needs and much more.
